# Animal-Game
## Introduction
This app implements a game similar to the [20 Questions](https://github.com/devansh287/20-questions-game) one, but on an Android platform instead of C++. Note: the questions will not load on the screen as I have not provided my username and password to the code. I am just showing this to demonstrate that I have experience working in Firebase.
## Objective (Taken from assignment instructions)
We will write a basic quiz game app named Animal Game, based on a similar game located on the web at animalgame.com. In this game, you, the human player, are supposed to think of any animal you like. The computer will try to guess what animal you are thinking of by asking you a series of Yes-or-No questions. Eventually the computer will have asked enough questions that it thinks it knows what object you are thinking of, and it will make a final guess about what your animal is. If this guess is correct, the computer wins; if not, you win.
